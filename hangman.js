//pseudocode review

// use cases:
// use 1: The user loads the page
// user knows how to use game
    //display underscores according to randomly chosen words
    // display guess remaining, wins, and losses

//var userInput; 
//randomly chosen word form our wordbank
//varcurrentword
//var drawnword =[]
//var underscores =[]
